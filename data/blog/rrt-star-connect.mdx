## Introduction

In robotics and autonomous systems, motion planning refers to computing a path from a starting configuration to a goal without colliding with obstacles. Sampling-based algorithms such as **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)** are popular for solving these problems in high-dimensional spaces due to their efficiency and simplicity.

However, the standard RRT algorithm is not guaranteed to find the shortest or most efficient path. **RRT\*** (RRT-Star) enhances RRT by providing optimal solutions over time through a process called **rewiring**. **RRT Connect** accelerates planning by growing trees from both the start and goal configurations. **RRT\* Connect** combines the optimality of RRT\* and the efficiency of RRT Connect, making it one of the most practical and powerful motion planners available.

## Background

### RRT

* Constructs a tree rooted at the start node by sampling random configurations.
* Expands greedily toward each random sample.
* Finds feasible paths quickly but not optimal ones.

### RRT\*

* Similar to RRT but improves the tree by rewiring to minimize cost (e.g., path length).
* Guarantees asymptotic optimality with enough samples.
* Slower than RRT due to the cost optimization overhead.

### RRT Connect

* Grows two trees: one from the start and one from the goal.
* Expands each tree aggressively toward random samples and attempts to connect the trees.
* Fast and efficient but doesn't optimize the path.

### RRT\* Connect

* Uses bidirectional tree growth from both start and goal.
* Applies cost-based rewiring to both trees like RRT\*.
* Attempts to connect the trees during each iteration.
* Offers fast convergence and guarantees optimality over time.

## RRT\* Connect Algorithm

### Core Concepts

**1. Trees from Both Ends:**
Two trees grow simultaneously â€” one from the start, one from the goal. Each tree expands toward a random sample, and they attempt to connect when close enough.

**2. Steering:**
Each new node is created by stepping from a nearby node toward a sampled point by a fixed step size (delta). This avoids adding distant or infeasible nodes.

**3. Rewiring:**
When a new node is added, the algorithm checks if it can connect nearby nodes more efficiently. If so, it rewires the tree to use the better path.

**4. Connection Attempt:**
When a new node is added to one tree, the other tree tries to connect to it by extending its own nodes in that direction.

### Code Skeleton (Python-style Pseudocode)

```python
def RRT_Star_Connect(x_init, x_goal, max_iter, delta):
    T_start = initialize_tree(x_init)
    T_goal = initialize_tree(x_goal)

    for i in range(max_iter):
        x_rand = sample_random()

        # Alternate tree expansion
        for T_a, T_b in [(T_start, T_goal), (T_goal, T_start)]:
            x_nearest = nearest_node(T_a, x_rand)
            x_new = steer(x_nearest, x_rand, delta)

            if collision_free(x_nearest, x_new):
                neighbors = get_neighbors(T_a, x_new)
                x_min = choose_best_parent(T_a, x_new, neighbors)
                T_a.add_node(x_new, parent=x_min)

                rewire(T_a, x_new, neighbors)

                if connect_trees(T_a, T_b, x_new, delta):
                    return construct_path(T_start, T_goal)

    return None
```

## Key Components Explained

### Sampling

Random configurations are drawn uniformly from the configuration space to explore feasible areas.

```python
def sample_random():
    return np.random.uniform(low=space_min, high=space_max)
```

### Nearest Node Search

Finds the existing node in the tree closest to the sampled point.

```python
def nearest_node(tree, x_rand):
    return min(tree.nodes, key=lambda node: distance(node, x_rand))
```

### Steering

Limits the expansion to a fixed step size for safety and resolution.

```python
def steer(x_nearest, x_rand, delta):
    direction = (x_rand - x_nearest) / np.linalg.norm(x_rand - x_nearest)
    return x_nearest + direction * delta
```

### Best Parent Selection

Among nearby nodes, selects the one that offers the lowest cost to the new node.

```python
def choose_best_parent(tree, x_new, neighbors):
    best = x_nearest
    min_cost = cost(x_nearest) + distance(x_nearest, x_new)
    for x_near in neighbors:
        new_cost = cost(x_near) + distance(x_near, x_new)
        if collision_free(x_near, x_new) and new_cost < min_cost:
            best = x_near
            min_cost = new_cost
    return best
```

### Rewiring

After adding a new node, checks nearby nodes to see if their cost can be reduced by connecting through the new node.

```python
def rewire(tree, x_new, neighbors):
    for x_near in neighbors:
        new_cost = cost(x_new) + distance(x_new, x_near)
        if new_cost < cost(x_near) and collision_free(x_new, x_near):
            tree.rewire(x_near, new_parent=x_new)
```

### Connecting Trees

Attempts to grow the other tree toward the newly added node. If successful, the algorithm terminates with a valid path.

```python
def connect_trees(T_a, T_b, x_new, delta):
    x_nearest = nearest_node(T_b, x_new)
    x_attempt = steer(x_nearest, x_new, delta)
    if collision_free(x_nearest, x_attempt):
        T_b.add_node(x_attempt, parent=x_nearest)
        return True
    return False
```

## Practical Notes

* **Goal Biasing:** Occasionally sample the goal to help the tree reach it faster.
* **Obstacle Checking:** Efficient collision checking is crucial for performance.
* **Nearest Neighbor Search:** Use spatial data structures like KD-trees to improve lookup speed.
* **Incremental Execution:** Can be run in real-time with early termination.
